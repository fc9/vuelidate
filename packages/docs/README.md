# Vuelidate

This is the repo for [Vuelidate 2 Docs](https://vuelidate.js.org).

## How to contribute

After cloning the repo run:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install the entire mono-repo deps, not only the docs. **Yarn is required**.

After installing you can cd into the docs package and run:

```bash
yarn dev:docs
```

This will open a local development version of the docs, powered by VuePress.

Please take a look at our [Contributing](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) docs, on how to write your commit messages and PRs.
